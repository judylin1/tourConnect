CODING CHALLENGE: Please complete the following coding challenge.  When complete, please attach your answer and any relevant files (test, etc.), and let us know how much time it took to complete the problem (including thinking through it, not just the implementation).  

Implement a function called stringify that emulates JSON.stringify. If you wanted it to be easy you'd say stringify = JSON.stringify - but we're looking for a solution from scratch. If you can't come up with a solution, that's ok! We're interested in your thought process - so feel free to break down the problem in comments, as well.  

##### Solution:
The solution can be found in the file named, 'stringify.js'. TDD done with Jasmine.  
To run test:
> jasmine  

Time to complete: 1 hour total.
